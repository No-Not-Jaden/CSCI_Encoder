## [1] Author
My name is Jaden Paterson, and at the time of writing this,
I'm a sophomore studying Computer Engineering at the University of Minnesota.
## [2] Notes
I use Java 17 aspects such as a record class and the ternary "?" operator.
## [3] CodeBook Runtime
The runtime complexity of the HuffmanCodeBook#contains(char c) and HuffmanCodeBook#getSequence(char c)
is O(1).
## [4] CodeTree Runtime
The runtime complexity of the HuffmanCodeTree#decode(BinarySequence seq)
is O(b) with b representing the number of bits in the sequence.
